Patriquin - 7th year	Sarah	130 Timber Mill Ave 	289-927-7091 	1			1	Single mother with boy 15May 6, 2017 - Brian & Gail McMonagle - She came to the door coughing, and apologized saying she has an infection resulting form dental surgery.  She is still in some amount of pain from the surgery.    There was a male voice in the background. She was holding in a large dog so the contact was short.Feb 3/17 Huppe/ Treacy : This was a very interesting visit - it involved three telephone numbers - the first two denying of her existence and the third from her mother in Scarborough.  She (the mother) apparently spent the previous evening with her daughter who went through dental surgery and was in terrible pain.  Could not contact her.  Her mother told us she could say whether she would answer us because of the pain she was experiencing.  Went to her house, rang the bell; however, she did not answer and the dog was barking.  We were told if we wanted to reschedule to do so, but we could also leave the groceries in the garage (which we could open) - we did just that.  (That's what you get for delivery services) but we are not here to judge - we did exactly that.

Heffering - RED FLAGGED see note below	Tara - CAUTION	201 White Oaks    (Be careful with this individual see below)	Known to Police - ARRESTED for Robbery	1				Mar 7/2012: I discovered after she left that when she came into the office she wandered downstairs to use the washroom and then throughout the church via the altar doorway. Cupboards and drawers were opened in the altar server’s room and the utility room. She also had a daily missal in her hands when I was talking to her which told me she could have only gotten that from the back counter of the church. This alarmed me. We also discovered that she had entered York University offices next door to “use their washroom”. The custodian escorted her out of the building immediately      This girl and her friend were arrested for theft and trespassing at St. John's school. Police have said they are well known to police and crack cocaine addicts.

She indicated that she has an appointment with her disability worker this week to sign papers to reactivate her disability payments until Old age assistance is started. I indicated that as she has no resources that we would assist her with taxi fare to the Welfare office appointment. I also indicated that if she required further food and vouchers before  the 2 month time limit between visits, it could  be waived When she has the appointment she was advised to call our line and we would arrange taxi fare asap.July 11, 2017 - Brian & Gail McMonagle: Met with Sharon as agreed.  She told us of the frustration she has had trying to apply for OAS.

Her social work case worker is trying to help her sort it out.  Gail also left a message for Frank McNulty about her plight thinking he may have some suggestions for her. We told her we hadn't heard from Frank as of yet but we would be in  touch with any information that may be helpful.
