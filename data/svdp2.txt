She has had surgery, claimed she was back and forth to Oshawa Hospital for check ups.  She last had help Feb 5.  I thought she was in dire need.  She insisted she would meet us in the lobby.  She had a friend help her with the groceries.  However we needed the bags back so we went upstairs with Danielle and friend.  I don\'t really know what to say next except that the apartment was disgusting---had to make room on the table to unload groceries, orange peels on the floor and just nothing in place.  There were also two men and two cats in the apartment.  Danielle was grateful for the assistance and was reminded of the wait period.  Now there is the story of the young girl who helped her carry the groceries.  She has a baby five months old.  We were no sooner home when we got a call from this young girl saying she needed formula and had no money until Thursday when her cheque would arrive.  What to do????  We brought her formula for the baby and gave her $10 voucher.  I also gave her an information sheet with all the agencies.  I know I am not supposed to judge but this  young lady was sitting in the apartment when all this food and vouchers were given to Danielle. I have listed her as a new client.  Her name ALYSHIA  BROWN  Also Danielle has TWO CATS!!! 			12/25/2010	12/25/2010	8/21/200910/14/20091/14/20102/5/20103/30/20108/2/201010/16/201012/25/2010	- Wyn- John/Chris (food and $35)- Shirley- Rita/Dick (food, formula, diapers, $35)- Wyn (See above.

This lady was referred to me by Denis on Feb.9th and I made a delivery to her of food and $35 in vouchers on the same date.  She also requested clothing and I issued a slip for the SVDP store in Oshawa for herself and her daughter.  She mentioned that she had called Peter on his cell and I requested that she refrain from doing so.  Unfortunately unknown to me at the time, Peter had already supplied her with $50 in vouchers and instructed her that when the person delivered food she had to advise them she had already received vouchers and shouldn\'t be given any more. She took the vouchers from me and never mentioned Peter\\\'s visit.  This lady therefore received $85 in vouchers within one or two days.  I will bring it up at the next meeting and see what others think, but my own feeling is that the next time she requests assistance she should only be given food and it should be explained to her that she won\'t be getting any vouchers due to the fact that she received more than double on one occasion.	491264	910	7/21/2010	4/24/2011	12/25/200712/25/200812/25/20091/26/20103/5/20107/21/20109/24/20104/24/2011	- 2007 Six times in 2007 including a Christmas present- 2008 Eight times in 2008 + christmas presents + $75- 2009 eight times including Christmas Parishioner- Sharon/Len (had a baby last week - food, baby stuff, $35, clothing v)- Sharon/Len (food and $35 - reminded to wait 2 mo next time)- Sharon/Len (food, diapers, $35, clothing voucher)- Peter (baby food, groceries, $30, store voucher up to $75 - no more..)Dennis (food and $40)
