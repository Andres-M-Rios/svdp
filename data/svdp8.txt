Cheeseman	Jonathan Joseph (Johnny)	no fixed address		1				He was released from jail and at one point slept in the SVDP bin at the parish.  We all heard of that performance.  He was in the parish office a number of times collecting vouchers and requested more help at the 5:00pm mass about three weeks ago.  Bernie and Roy felt compassion for him and gave him vouchers to help him out.  Father put him up in the parish centre for one night. Vicki says that he tried to sell vouchers to a person at the York campus next door to us.  We feel that this is abusing our assistance and should advise him of such and deny him help financially if approached again.			 	11/2/2007	11/2/2007	(approximate date) -Bernie and Roy (see the information above)	transient

This lady was referred to me by Denis on Feb.9th and I made a delivery to her of food and $35 in vouchers on the same date.  She also requested clothing and I issued a slip for the SVDP store in Oshawa for herself and her daughter.  She mentioned that she had called Peter on his cell and I requested that she refrain from doing so.  Unfortunately unknown to me at the time, Peter had already supplied her with $50 in vouchers and instructed her that when the person delivered food she had to advise them she had already received vouchers and shouldn't be given any more. She took the vouchers from me and never mentioned Peter\'s visit.  This lady therefore received $85 in vouchers within one or two days.  I will bring it up at the next meeting and see what others think, but my own feeling is that the next time she requests assistance she should only be given food and it should be explained to her that she won't be getting any vouchers due to the fact that she received more than double on one occasion.	491264	910	12/25/2008	12/25/2008	12/25/20072/8/20083/17/20084/23/20086/11/20087/11/20089/3/200810/8/200812/25/2008	- Six times in 2007 including a Christmas present- Josephine + Peter (box of food and $80 see note above)- Peter- John/Cath (again explained 2mo rule: food and $20)- Bernie- Peter/Shirley  (food and $35 + suggested SA foodbank)- Peter/Marjorie (food+$35+clothing voucher for self & daughter)- Ron/Maureen (food and $35) furious that it was so little- presents + $75	abusive
