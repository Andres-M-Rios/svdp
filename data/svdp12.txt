Gagnon	Danielle	100 White Oaks #1110	905-493-7477	1	1	2		has a 19 mo old babyTwo children, 5, 10from Wyn:Baby is now eleven months old.  Danielle requested SIZE 6 diapers which we did not have.  She has had surgery, claimed she was back and forth to Oshawa Hospital for check ups.  She last had help Feb 5.  I thought she was in dire need.  She insisted she would meet us in the lobby.  She had a friend help her with the groceries.  However we needed the bags back so we went upstairs with Danielle and friend.  I don\'t really know what to say next except that the apartment was disgusting---had to make room on the table to unload groceries, orange peels on the floor and just nothing in place.  There were also two men and two cats in the apartment.  Danielle was grateful for the assistance and was reminded of the wait period.  Now there is the story of the young girl who helped her carry the groceries.  She has a baby five months old.  We were no sooner home when we got a call from this young girl saying she needed formula and had no money until Thursday when her cheque would arrive.  What to do????  We brought her formula for the baby and gave her $10 voucher.  I also gave her an information sheet with all the agencies.  I know I am not supposed to judge but this  young lady was sitting in the apartment when all this food and vouchers were given to Danielle. I have listed her as a new client.  Her name ALYSHIA  BROWN  Also Danielle has TWO CATS!!! 			12/25/2010	12/25/2010	8/21/200910/14/20091/14/20102/5/20103/30/20108/2/201010/16/201012/25/2010	- Wyn- John/Chris (food and $35)- Shirley- Rita/Dick (food, formula, diapers, $35)- Wyn (See above.

Heffering *****	Tara - Red Flagged	201 White Oaks    (Be careful with this individual see below)		1				I discovered after she left that when she came into the office she wandered downstairs to use the washroom and then throughout the church via the altar doorway. Cupboards and drawers were opened in the altar serverís room and the utility room. She also had a daily missal in her hands when I was talking to her which told me she could have only gotten that from the back counter of the church. This alarmed me. We also discovered that she had entered York University offices next door to ìuse their washroomî. The custodian escorted her out of the building immediately      This girl and her friend were arrested for theft and trespassing at St. John's school.
