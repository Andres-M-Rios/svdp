Heffering - RED FLAGGED see note below	Tara - CAUTION	201 White Oaks    (Be careful with this individual see below)	Known to Police - ARRESTED for Robery	1				I discovered after she left that when she came into the office she wandered downstairs to use the washroom and then throughout the church via the altar doorway. Cupboards and drawers were opened in the altar server’s room and the utility room. She also had a daily missal in her hands when I was talking to her which told me she could have only gotten that from the back counter of the church. This alarmed me. We also discovered that she had entered York University offices next door to “use their washroom”. The custodian escorted her out of the building immediately      This girl and her friend were arrested for theft and trespassing at St. John's school. Police have said they are well known to police and crack cocaine addicts.
