Heffering - RED FLAGGED see note below	Tara - Red Flagged	201 White Oaks    (Be careful with this individual see below)		1				I discovered after she left that when she came into the office she wandered downstairs to use the washroom and then throughout the church via the altar doorway. Cupboards and drawers were opened in the altar serverís room and the utility room. She also had a daily missal in her hands when I was talking to her which told me she could have only gotten that from the back counter of the church. This alarmed me. We also discovered that she had entered York University offices next door to ìuse their washroomî. The custodian escorted her out of the building immediately      This girl and her friend were arrested for theft and trespassing at St. John's school.
