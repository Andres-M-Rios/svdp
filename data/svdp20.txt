She is still in some amount of pain from the surgery.    There was a male voice in the background. She was holding in a large dog so the contact was short.Feb 3/17 Huppe/ Treacy : This was a very interesting visit - it involved three telephone numbers - the first two denying of her existence and the third from her mother in Scarborough.  She (the mother) apparently spent the previous evening with her daughter who went through dental surgery and was in terrible pain.  Could not contact her.  Her mother told us she could say whether she would answer us because of the pain she was experiencing.  Went to her house, rang the bell; however, she did not answer and the dog was barking.  We were told if we wanted to reschedule to do so, but we could also leave the groceries in the garage (which we could open) - we did just that.  (That's what you get for delivery services) but we are not here to judge - we did exactly that.
