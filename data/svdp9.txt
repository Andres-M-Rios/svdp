This lady was referred to me by Denis on Feb.9th and I made a delivery to her of food and $35 in vouchers on the same date.  She also requested clothing and I issued a slip for the SVDP store in Oshawa for herself and her daughter.  She mentioned that she had called Peter on his cell and I requested that she refrain from doing so.  Unfortunately unknown to me at the time, Peter had already supplied her with $50 in vouchers and instructed her that when the person delivered food she had to advise them she had already received vouchers and shouldn't be given any more. She took the vouchers from me and never mentioned Peter\'s visit.  This lady therefore received $85 in vouchers within one or two days.  I will bring it up at the next meeting and see what others think, but my own feeling is that the next time she requests assistance she should only be given food and it should be explained to her that she won't be getting any vouchers due to the fact that she received more than double on one occasion.	491264	910	12/25/2009	12/25/2009	12/25/200712/25/20081/13/20093/26/20095/10/20096/26/20098/31/200911/1/200912/7/200912/25/2009	- 2007 Six times in 2007 including a Christmas present- 2008 Eight times in 2008 + christmas presents + $75- Rita/Dick- Shirley (food and $45)- John/Cath (food and $45 - filled in clothes form for Danelle & Kasandra)- Peter/John Clarke (food and $35 - No more until end August)- Roy/Lorraine (food, $35, asked to wait 3 mo for next time)- Peter (food + $35 clothing voucher)- Peter/Maureen (clothing voucher - to replace last,expired, one)- Christmas Parishioner	abusive
