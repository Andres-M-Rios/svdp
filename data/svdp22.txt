Her mother told us she could say whether she would answer us because of the pain she was experiencing.  Went to her house, rang the bell; however, she did not answer and the dog was barking.  We were told if we wanted to reschedule to do so, but we could also leave the groceries in the garage (which we could open) - we did just that.
